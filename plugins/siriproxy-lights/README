SiriProxy Lights Plugin
======================
This plugin interfaces between Siri and a USB device to control mains voltages. It can use either an
FTDI serial device to bit-bang relays on and off, or a dimmer board that implements digital phase-angle 
shifts based on an ATMega8u2 (to my knowledge only one of which exists).

Using an FTDI chip
------------------
The FTDI solution simply connects the electromagnet of a relay to one of the bit bang channels. If your
relay cannot close with five volts, a transistor and higher voltage (say, 12v) source would be needed. 

A quick word if you haven't a ton of experience with clunky, slow relays, an electromagnet is essentially
a dead short; use a resistor to limit the current allowed through the coil so that the voltage does 
not drop. Your USB bus normally won't have much trouble with 100mA at 5v, so if you can't get the relay 
to open with a 50Î© series resistor, you'll need to use a transistor to a higher-voltage source.

Using Dimmers
-------------
Work is ongoing to clean up the API and release the schematics and source code for the dimmer board.
Essentially, it uses a zero-cross detector to vary the phase angle at which a triac is triggered. Mine
currently has 2 channels. Although the firmware supports more, USB communication causes the second channel
to flicker momentarily, presumably because the triac is triggered late.


No license because Christ would forgive rather than sue anyway.
